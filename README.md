## About

Job Tracker is a React application that allows a user to track contacts, pending job applications, and GitHub commits as they work their way toward a job. The tracker is build on specifications provided by Flatiron School in their career prep materials. 

Log In functionality is pending.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

This project relies on a Ruby on Rails API that must be run separately, which is available at this Github repository: https://github.com/aohibbard/job-tracker-backend . The project is configured such that the Rails receives requests from localhost:3000/api. Without configuring specific ports, you can achieve this functionality by booting the API up first from the backend using the `rails s` command and then starting the React frontend using `npm start`. If the Rails server is not configured to localhost:3000/api, fetch commands must be updated with the appropriate URL in the src/actions folders.

Github Commit fetches are currently configured to this account. 

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
